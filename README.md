## 🔗 Shared Architectural Elements

Despite regional distinctions, both temple styles share essential spiritual and structural features:

🔹 **Garbhagriha** – Inner sanctum where the deity resides  
🔹 **Axis Mundi** – Cosmic vertical connection between earth and heaven  
🔹 **Mandapas** – Pillared halls for devotees  
🔹 **Plinth/Base Platform** – Raised foundation for prominence  
🔹 **Ornate carvings & symbolism** – Reflecting Vedic philosophy and cosmic order

✨ These common elements symbolize a **unified spiritual tradition**, tailored regionally through materials, climate, and aesthetics.
